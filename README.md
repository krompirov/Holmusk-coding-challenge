## This repo contains the code for Holmusk's coding challenge.

### Task
Imagine that the housing and development board approaches you with this dataset and wants to understand the drivers of prices of the houses.

Dataset: https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices

You can augment your analysis based on publicly available data e.g. location of business districts, MRT stations, consumer price index etc.

### Problem Statement
Effective policy-making necessitates a firm grasp of the factors surrounding the issue at hand. The HDB exists to plan and develop Singapore's public housing estates, so as to provide quality and affordable housing options for Singaporeans. In order to continue ensuring housing remains affordable for all, it is imperative that we understand what drives price action in the public housing market. This project seeks to examine publicly available housing resale price data from HDB to better understand what factors determine the price of a HDB unit.
